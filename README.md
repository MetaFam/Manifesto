# Manifesto

We have completed the first design phase of the Meta-Manifesto of which the outcome can be seen in [this Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kv7hEH8=/) board.

Such an outcome is serving us to co-create the first draft version in [this HackMD document](https://hackmd.io/@cZ5K_ThTTxyuSwxcbu-gvg/HkGQM1sMU/edit).

Although, if you have an independent/stand-alone Manifesto submission, please add it this repo as a text file.  

If you have questions, ping @Yalor#5979 or @Gus#1951 on [Discord](https://discord.gg/SknkPu)
